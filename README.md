# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Malte!

I'm a data scientist with a passion for solving real-world problems using data. My technical toolbox includes advanced analytics in **R** and **Python**, robust **machine learning models**, and deep experience working with **relational databases** and **SQL**. My work is driven by a love for uncovering insights, building predictive systems, and turning messy datasets into actionable intelligence.

## ðŸ”¬ My Skillset

- ðŸ’» **Languages & Tools**  
  - **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn, Streamlit  
  - **R**: tidyverse, caret, glmnet, Shiny, ggplot2  
  - **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite), data modeling, ETL processes  
  - **Version Control**: Git, GitHub  
  - **APIs & Data Pipelines**: REST APIs, data ingestion, automation  
  - **Cloud & Deployment**: basic experience with Docker, AWS S3, and R Shiny Server
  - **AI & LLM Tools**: Claude, OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/4), AI workflow integration with **MCP** and prompt engineering


- ðŸ“ˆ **What I Do**  
  - Build statistical and ML models for prediction and classification tasks  
  - Clean, transform, and visualize complex datasets  
  - Develop dashboards and apps for interactive data exploration  
  - Design end-to-end workflows from raw data to insights

## âš½ Sports Data, Modeling & Academic Work

As a lifelong football enthusiast, I combine deep statistical modeling with real-world sports applications:

- ðŸŽ“ **Masterâ€™s Thesis (Grade: 1.0)**  
  Focused on football outcome prediction using **XGBoost** and hybrid statistical learning models (e.g., Poisson, Skellam). I evaluated prediction accuracy against bookmaker odds and tested profitability in betting strategy simulations.

- ðŸ“ˆ **End-of-Season Modeling Project**  
  A large-scale simulation of football leagues that forecasted standings, relegation, and qualification probabilities â€” **featured in *Gazzetta dello Sport*, *OneFootball*, and other international media outlets.**

- ðŸ”§ **Contributor to the `Shiny` package**  
  Active in improving features and documentation for the popular R framework used to build interactive web applications.
